# 📊 Hospital Analytics Dashboard - User Guide

## For Administrators with Zero Technical Knowledge

This guide explains all the visualizations and charts in your Analytics Dashboard in simple, easy-to-understand terms.

## 🎯 What is This Dashboard?

The Analytics Dashboard is like a **visual report card** for your hospital. Instead of reading through lots of numbers and data, you can see **colorful charts and graphs** that tell you:
- How many patients are visiting
- Which doctors are busiest
- How much money the pharmacy is making
- Which medicines need to be restocked

Think of it as a **"health check" for your hospital**, not for patients, but for your business!
